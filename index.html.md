# era5_sandbox


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

Here we are developing functions and code for the ERA5 dataset project.
The goal is for most exposure data to be made available at the daily
resolution when possible. Finer resolutions shouldn’t ever be needed for
our purposes, and it should then be relatively easy to aggregate at
coarser resolutions, such as weekly or monthly.

Variables should generally be made available from 2010 onward, as that’s
where our clinic data starts.

All data are ideally made available at the “healthshed” geographical
level. Healthsheds are defined as geographical areas where people who
live all go to the same clinic. There are a total of ~2700 public
clinics in Madagascar, hence ~2700 healthsheds, with each healthshed
containing ~10000 people on average.

Preliminary list of environmental variables

- ☐ 2-m air temperature from ERA5: daily min, max, mean

- ☐ 2-m air dew point temperature from ERA5: daily min, max, mean

- ☐ Precipitation: daily total (ERA5)

- ☐ Sea surface temperature: daily average and maximum in the nearest
  neighbor for each healthshed.

- ☐ Precipitation: daily total (CHIRPS)

- ☐ Chlorophyll-A (Giacomo)

- ☐ Wealth index: Available from Giacomo

- ☐ NDVI

- ☐ Tropical storm

- ☐ Flooding

- ☐ Deforestation

- ☐ Linking/segmenting healthsheds into climate zones and other

- ☐ Relative humidity: daily average (lower priority)
