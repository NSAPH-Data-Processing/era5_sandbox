# Introduction to the ERA 5 Data


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

Important: we need to install the CDS API first, so you’ll need to grab
an API key. First, you must register for an account and accept the T&Cs,
afterwhich the page
[here](https://ecmwf-projects.github.io/copernicus-training-c3s/cds-tutorial.html#install-the-cds-api-key)
will autopopulate an API key for you. The following code shows a test
case to make sure your API key works

``` python
import cdsapi

client = cdsapi.Client()

dataset = 'reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels'
request = {
  'product_type': ['reanalysis'],
  'variable': ['geopotential'],
  'year': ['2024'],
  'month': ['03'],
  'day': ['01'],
  'time': ['13:00'],
  'pressure_level': ['1000'],
  'data_format': 'grib',
}
target = 'download.grib'

client.retrieve(dataset, request, target)
```

This demonstration is expected to amass 9GB of data for raw raster files
(24 years, 12 files per year). The demonstration generates the 24 years
of heat measures across Kenya administrative boundaries, in 1-month
periods of ERA5-Land data across Kenya with three variables (2-m temp,
dew point temp, skin temp)

``` python
# imports as recommended by the github repo
import cdsapi
import geopandas as gpd
import os
```

I’ll use pyprojroot to specify a data path

``` python
from pyprojroot.here import here

ecmw_dir = here("data")
```

``` python
def create_dir(path):

    if not os.path.exists(path):
        os.makedirs(path)

    return path
```

``` python
create_dir(ecmw_dir)
```

``` python
# create a directory for the kenya data
create_dir(os.path.join(ecmw_dir, "Kenya_GADM"))
```

Next, we need to manually fetch this GADM file for Kenya from here:
https://gadm.org/download_country.html

This is a boundaries geopackage; GeoBoundaries is a global database of
administrative boundaries (e.g., countries, states, provinces,
districts). Hence, this file provides the boundaries for Kenyan regions

``` python
kenya_shape =  gpd.read_file(os.path.join(ecmw_dir, "Kenya_GADM/gadm41_KEN.gpkg"), layer = "ADM_ADM_0")
```

``` python
kenya_shape
```

The bounding box represents the coordinates of the shapefile, which is
what we’ll use to query Copernicus. Think of it like a mask provided in
a file

``` python
kenya_bbox = kenya_shape.total_bounds
```

``` python
kenya_bbox
```

    array([33.909588  , -4.720417  , 41.92621613,  5.06116581])

Technical: Add a small buffer around the bounding box to ensure the
whole region is queried, and round the parameters to a 0.1 resolution. A
0.1 resolution is applied because the resolution of netCDF ERA5 data is
.25x.25
https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference

``` python
kenya_bbox[0] = round(kenya_bbox[0], 1) - 0.1
kenya_bbox[1] = round(kenya_bbox[1], 1) - 0.1
kenya_bbox[2] = round(kenya_bbox[2], 1) + 0.1
kenya_bbox[3] = round(kenya_bbox[3], 1) + 0.1
```

``` python
# to build a query, specify [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]
query_area = [kenya_bbox[0], kenya_bbox[1], kenya_bbox[2], kenya_bbox[3]]
```

``` python
query_years = list(range(2000, 2024))
query_years_str = [str(x) for x in query_years]

query_months = list(range(1, 13))
query_months_str = [str(x).zfill(2) for x in query_months]
```

``` python
output_dir = create_dir(os.path.join(ecmw_dir, "ERA5_out"))
```

``` python
for year_str in query_years_str:
    # Track progress
    print("Now processing year ", year_str, "\n")

    # For each year, the query is divided into each month sections. 
    # If a request is too large, it will not be accepted by the CDS servers, 
    # so this division of requests is required.

    for month_str in query_months_str:
        # Track progress
        print("Now processing month ", month_str, "\n")

From the logs, it looks like one month of data takes approximately 10
minutes. In this query, we might end up with 48 hours of downloading for
